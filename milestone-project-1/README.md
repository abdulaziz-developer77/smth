## Pro Solutions

This project is a summary of learning of the three modules of the Full Stack Developer Cours - HTML, CSS, User Centric Frontend Development, the aim of which was to create a mobile, fully responsive website. This responsive website was created for the "Pro Solutions" video game console service, which I do as my hobby.

Thanks to this website, people interested in repairing their consoles will have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the services, prices and will be able to contact the service directly for advice via the contact form.

## 1️⃣ Project Construction 👷

This project uses the Bootstrap Framework to create a multi-page, fully responsive website with a mobile-first approach. The project is fully compliant with the requirements set by Code Institute, to create website using HTML, CSS and bootstrap framework.

Despite the above, the website contains two forms with very simple java-script that after submit will confirm submit and reset the form.

As my skill level grows, the functionality of the website will evolve to include java script features, back-end features and online payments. Then it can be used for commercial purposes.

## 2️⃣ User Experience Design 🧠

### To whom the website is addressed❓

The main target of the website are people who are looking for a game console repair service for repair or consultation.

### What the visitors expect❓

The main reasons for visiting service website are:

- 👓 To see what the service offer.

- 💰 To check prices for a repair.

- 📞 To contact the service.

- 📓 To book a service.

### Why does my website meet these requirements❓

- 👓 The main page presents and illustrates what repairs are carried out by the service. Encourage to cooperate and presents customer reviews.

- 💰 It is very easy to find the page with prices and a brief description of the repair using the navbar Price tab or the large button visible on the main page.
